## App Architecture
AI Mentor is built with an extremely simple tech stack following the "Do the simple thing first" engineering principle:
- 100% native Kotlin
- MVC design (activity, XML layouts, basic data models)
- Delegate pattern to modularize code
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking, [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) for animation, and [Android-Iconics](https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics) for iconography
