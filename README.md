## App Architecture
AI Mentor is built with an extremely basic tech stack following the "Do the simple thing first" engineering principle:
- 100% native Kotlin
- MVC design (activity, XML layouts, basic data models)
- Delegate pattern to modularize code
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking, [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) for animation, and [Android-Iconics](https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics) for iconography

This is the engineering philosophy the Instagram Android app used to get to 1 billion users, so it's good enough for this app and all my other side projects.

Since this app requires a secret API key to call OpenAI's ChatGPT API, I'm not able to welcome contributions at this time. If you have feedback on the app, please share it in your review on Google Play!
